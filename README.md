Sublime [chatgpt] Token Counter

Pretty plain plugin that counts chars and tokens in selected text and presents it onscreen beforehand the selection itself.

> Plugin will freez editor for a few seconds on each tokenizer change due to it required to download one on the machine. It'll work pretty smooth afterwards.
